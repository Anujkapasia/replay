// What should be configurable/customisable from here or replacements to this file?

/*

- Graphics (svg)
- Class name prefix - consider 16.3 context API
- CSS files to include
- Strings (localisations)
- Video engine and general player configuration (big structure...)


Context API can be useful for:
- Class name prefixes
- Themes via CSS in JS
- Strings
- Graphics
- Video state etc. I.e. Redux or setState replacement.

Or automatic prop pass-down?

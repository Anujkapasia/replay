# Overview

## The holy trinity

Replay is built on three main concepts constituted in React components.

* The **video streamer**.
* The **player controller**.
* **Controls** and components composed to player UI, being **connected** to the player controller.

Replay aims to provide a streamlined and consistent way of letting data flow between the playing stream and the UI.

## Data (property) flow

### From the playing stream to player controls

The video streamer downloads and renders the stream. 

The player controller gets notified on playback progress and video stream state updates. By being a React context provider, the state properties are passed down from the player controller to player controls and other UI components.

The controls can observe such state updates by being wrapped in a HOC connecting to the React context provided by the player controller.

### From player controls to the playing stream

The HOC/React context connector provides a callback for setting playback properties. Such properties can affect all sides of playback, e.g. pausing, changing volume, selecting subtitles.

When the user interacts with the control, e.g. selecting a subtitle language, the property setter callback is invoked with the changed property being the deseired subtitle track. This incovation is propagated back to the video streamer, which effectuates the selection.

## Cardinality of components

In the Replay player, either the default one, or a custom one, the following applies:

#### Video streamer

* There are many **_implementations_** of this concept. They currently cover different streaming technologies, like Shaka Player, HLS.js. Later they might also wrap different functions (e.g. 360Â°/VR) or full players (e.g. Vimeo).
* In a component tree of a complete Replay player, there is exactly one **_instance_** of a video streamer currently used.

#### Player controller

* There is only one current **_implementation_** of this concept. 
* In a component tree of a complete Replay player, there is exactly one **_instance_** of a player controller.

#### Connected controls
* There are **_many components_** following the "connected control" pattern, and more can easily be created. It is only one current **_implementation_** of this pattern using the connectControl() HOC.
* In a component tree of a complete Replay player, there are usually one **_instance_** of each component implementing this pattern. However it is not a problem having more instances added. For instance, a SkipButton can be added twice in order to set up both skip backward and skip forward buttons.

## Technologies and tools used in this project

#### For npm package consumers

* Statical [Flow typing](https://flow.org). As a npm package consumer with Flow enabled and enforced (through `// @flow`), the Replay player or components should all appear as typed, and the usage will be type checked.

#### For project contributors

* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)/[Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) tests.
* React [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and [lazy](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/23/react-v-16-6.html) APIs.
* Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
* [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) documentation with live code examples through [MDX](https://mdxjs.com).
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) is used for building the packaged files.
* Currently automatically built with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com).

#### Some design principles on top of this:

* Utilising common ES2019 language features.
* Performant UI, avoiding updates to the full element UI tree when any of the properties changes.
* Reduce code bloat for npm package users, only including code parts and assets being required.
* Avoid using React APIs subject to deprecation, e.g. `componentWillReceiveProps()`.

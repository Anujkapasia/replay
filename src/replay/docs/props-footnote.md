Props marked with ⇘ are updated with the video streamer's [state property](/reference/observable-stream-state) having the same name, when connected by the [`connectControl()` HOC](/architecture/connected-controls#connecting-the-controls). The ︎`setProperties()` callback prop is marked with ︎⇗ because it is connected for changing the playback state. More info in the architecture description of [two-way data flow](/architecture/overview#arrows-and-boxes).

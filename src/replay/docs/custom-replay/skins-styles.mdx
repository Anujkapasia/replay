# Custom skins and styles


* All class names are prefixed for the prevention of style conflicts or coexisting page styles interfering with player styles. By default the prefix is `replay-`. E.g. `audio-selector` is in practice `replay-audio-selector`.
* Many controls are just concrete usages of generic components. E.g. both the fullscreen and play/pause button is a ToggleButton. These share behaviour and also have common generic class names listed in the DOM and class name table.
* The DOM and style table does not include children or content elements.
* The DOM and style table only represents the "rendered" state.
* When the DOM and style table's state column only contains one class name, there is also a state without the class name.

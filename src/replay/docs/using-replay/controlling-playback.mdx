# Controlling the playback programmatically

## Prerequisites

This chapters describe the API parts of the Replay component available for controlling the playback, or for observing all sides of the playback progress and state.

For the following examples, the same prerequisites apply as in the [Inserting Replay](/replay/insert#prerequisites) chapter.

## Playback operations

Replay provides methods for controlling the playback, like `play()`, `pause()`, `setVolume()`, `mute()`, `setPosition()`, `setSelectedTextTrack()`, and more.

Playback methods are exposed to Replay component consumers through a callback prop `onPlaybackActionsReady`. Specify a method as this property in order to get hold of these methods. Besides the straightforward operations above, there are two special methods provided in the callback.

`setProperties()` is one common method that can be used for all playback operations. This method is passed along with `play()`, `setPosition()`, `capBitrate()` etc. The latter are just sugar methods that call `setProperties()` with different keys and values. `setProperties()` accepts an object with the properties to be set.

See TODO: link for a full reference of playback actions.

See TODO: link for a full reference of playback properties that can be used with setProperties.

Another method returned is `inspect()`. This returns an object with the current playback state, containing properties also exposed through the `onStreamStateChange` callback. 

Observing the playback state properties is discussed thoroughly in the next chapter. It is recommended to keep track of the state reactively, through an `onStreamStateChange` callback instead of using inspect().

The next chapter contains a full code example for controlling and observing the playback outside the Replay player.

```javascript
const playbackActionsReady = ({ play, setPosition, setProperties }) => {
  this.playVideo = play;
  this.setPlaybackPosition = setPosition;
  this.setPlaybackProperties = setProperties;
}

/// In e.g. click handlers for buttons outside the Replay player.

this.handleRestartClick = () => {
  if (this.setPlaybackPosition) {
    this.setPlaybackPosition(0);
  }
};

this.handleStartClick = () => {
  if (this.playVideo) {
    this.playVideo();
  }
};

// The alternative way, setting properties instead of calling a dedicated method, e.g. unmute().

this.handleUnmuteClick = () => {
  if (this.setPlaybackProperties) {
    this.setPlaybackProperties({ isMuted: false });
  }
}; 

```

## Observing the stream playback state

Playback state consists of playback position, duration, stream mode, pause, seek, and buffering state, available text and audio tracks, bitrate (if adaptive streaming is used).

The `onStreamStateChange` callback prop is invoked when any of these playback state properties changes. The callback is invoked with an object containing the changes as keys/values.

```javascript
this.handleStreamStateChange = stateProperties => {
  if ('position' in stateProperties) {
    console.log('Playback position is', stateProperties.position);
  }
  if ('volume' in stateProperties) {
    console.log('The volume is changed into', stateProperties.volume);
  }
  if (stateProperties.isPaused) {
    console.log('The playback was paused.');
  }
};
```

See TODO: link for a full reference of state properties.

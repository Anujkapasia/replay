# Inserting Replay into your React app

This chapter demonstrates how you can:

* Include the player in your own code.
* Specify what to play.
* Applying some playback settings.
* Control and observe the playback state.

*Note that all examples underneath with actual video include the [`initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}` property](/replay/api#initialplaybackprops-initialplaybackprops), so that the examples don't play wildly all over this page. Please remove when copying to real app code.*

## Prerequisites

### Installing the Replay npm package

If not already done:

```sh
npm install vimond-replay --save
```

### Importing dependencies

All code examples below need the following import statements:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Replay } from 'vimond-replay';
import 'vimond-replay/lib/index.css';
```

Or substitute the CSS `import` statement with your desired CSS inclusion mechanism, e.g. SASS.

### Video/stream technology support

Out of the box, Replay supports video files that can be played natively in the browser. That typically means MP4 or WebM videos progressively downloaded from a web server location.

By including alternative [VideoStreamer](/architecture/video-streamers) components, Replay can be used for adaptive streams. These cover HLS and DASH streams with live, DVR, embedded text tracks, and DRM if needed. Docs yet to be written, but here is an [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/) example:

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source="https://video-dev.github.io/streams/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8"
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}>
    <HlsjsVideoStreamer/>
  </Replay>
</Playground>


## Inserting the player with a progressive video source

Please remember the import statements discussed above. Include the `source` prop in order to load a video. This prop can be a string with the video URL, or an object containing several pieces of technical details in order to play the video/stream appropriately. Essential is the `streamUrl` property, referring to the video file or adaptive stream URL (if applicable). The object variant is shown in later examples.

This example is live. Press play to test the playback:

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4"
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}
  />
</Playground>

Note that Replay doesn't include a poster feature. This is best implemented outside the player component. The player can be inserted without specifying a source, and it will render, but remain inactive.

When the `source` prop is changed, either from unspecified, or from an earlier set source, a new playback will start. Set the same prop to null in order to stop playback.

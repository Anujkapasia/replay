# Inserting Replay into your React app

This and the following pages demonstrates how you can:

* Include the player in your own code.
* Specify what to play.
* Applying some playback settings.
* Control and observe the playback state.

*Note that all examples with actual video include the [`initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}` property](/replay/api#initialplaybackprops-initialplaybackprops), so that the examples don't play wildly all over the pages. Please remove this prop when copying to real app code.*

## Prerequisites

### Requirements

Minimum React version for Replay is 16.3. If using the [compound video streamer](/advanced-playback/adaptive-streaming#enabling-playback-for-multiple-streaming-technologies-based-on-stream-technology-resolution), React 16.6 is required. In this case, a bundler supporting dynamic `import()` statements, is also required.

### Installing the Replay npm package

If not already done:

```sh
npm install vimond-replay --save
```

### Importing dependencies

All code examples below need the following import statements:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Replay } from 'vimond-replay';
import 'vimond-replay/index.css';
```

Or substitute the CSS `import` statement with your desired CSS inclusion mechanism, e.g. SASS.

### Video/stream technology support

Out of the box, Replay supports video files that can be played natively in the browser. That typically means MP4 or WebM videos progressively downloaded from a web server location.

The [Adaptive streaming](/replay/adaptive-streaming) chapter explains how to add support for adaptive streaming.

## Inserting the player with a progressive video source

Please remember the import statements discussed above. Include the `source` prop in order to load a video. This prop can be a string with the video URL, or an object containing several pieces of technical details in order to play the video/stream appropriately. Essential is the `streamUrl` property, referring to the video file or adaptive stream URL (if applicable). The object variant is shown in later examples.

This example is live. Press play to test the playback:

<Playground>
  <Replay
    source="public/example-media/progressive.mp4"
    initialPlaybackProps={{ isPaused: true }}
  />
</Playground>

Note that Replay doesn't include a poster feature. This is best implemented outside the player component. The player can be inserted without specifying a source, and it will render, but remain inactive.

When the `source` prop is changed, either from unspecified, or from an earlier set source, a new playback will start. Set the same prop to null in order to stop playback.

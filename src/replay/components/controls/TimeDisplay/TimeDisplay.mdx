# TimeDisplay component

Presents the current position of a playback, and the duration of a stream. For live streams, displays clock time or timeshift offset.

## Summary

The display switches mode based on the `playMode` property. When this has a value of `'ondemand'`, both `duration` and `position` props are formatted and displayed. If it has a value of `'livedvr'`, it can either display only time-of-day clock time based on the prop `absolutePosition`, or 00:00 when playing at the live edge, or negative times when timeshifted. By setting the value `'live-offset'` on the prop `liveDisplayMode`, the latter option with 00:00 and negative times is selected. When displaying time-of-day clock times, duration is not displayed.

## Example

<Playground>
  <ShowCase render={({ setProperties, position }) => (
    <>
      <TimeDisplay playMode="ondemand" position={123.4} duration={234.5}/>
      <TimeDisplay playMode="livedvr" liveDisplayMode="live-offset" position={123} duration={234}/>
      <TimeDisplay playMode="livedvr" liveDisplayMode="live-offset" position={234} duration={234}/>
      <TimeDisplay playMode="livedvr" absolutePosition={new Date('2018-11-07T05:14:13Z')} position={234} duration={234}/>
    </>
  )}/>
</Playground>

This example shows four different display modes.

## Props

<PropsTable of={TimeDisplay} />

Props marked with â‡˜ are updated with the video streamer's state property having the same name, when connected by the `connectControl()` HOC.

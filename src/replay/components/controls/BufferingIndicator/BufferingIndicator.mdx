# BufferingIndicator component

Displays any overlay (animation, graphics, etc.) when a buffering, starting, or seeking state is reported.

## Summary

The main concept of this component is to display and animate an overlay when the user needs to wait for playback to start or resume (buffering).

The overlay is specified as the component's child, or in the `content` prop.

If the prop `renderStrategy` is set to `'always'`, the content will always be rendered. However, the class name "buffering" (with prefix) will be added to the compoent's root element when the state is buffering.

If the prop `renderStrategy` is set to `'when-buffering'`, no content will be rendered when not buffering. The drawback of this approach is that the indicator will stop displaying abruptly, and a smooth fade-out animation cannot be applied. 

The state of buffering is set when one or both of the props `isBuffering` or `isSeeking` are set to true, or if the `playState` prop is set to `'starting'`, `'buffering'`, `'seeking'`.

## Example

<Playground>
  <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'gray', height: '120px', padding: '25px' }}>
    <BufferingIndicator 
      renderStrategy="always"
      isBuffering={false}
      isSeeking={false}
      playState="starting" >
        <LoadingAnimation/>
    </BufferingIndicator>
  </div>
</Playground>

In this example, the animation is showing because `playState="starting""`. Try experimenting with other values for playState, and with `true` for isBuffering/isSeeking.


## Props

<PropsTable of={BufferingIndicator} />

Props marked with â‡˜ are updated with the video streamer's state property having the same name, when connected by the `connectControl()` HOC.

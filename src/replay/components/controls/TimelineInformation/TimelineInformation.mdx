# TimelineInformation component

Position preview tooltip for timeline. When the mouse pointer is over the timeline, displays the corresponding stream position or time-of-day clock time for the pointer position.

## Summary

This component is used as a child to the `<Timeline/>` component. It gets a `previewValue` prop set by the parent Timeline, containing a relative position between 0 and the `duration` prop value. The parent control is responsible for tracking mouse positions, and to report the target seek position while dragging. Like `<TimeDisplay/>`, the tooltip presents a clock time preview in the tooltip for live streams. For this, it needs the `absoluteStartPosition` of the stream to be specified.

The tooltip only displays if at least one of the props `isPointerInside` or `isDragging` is set to `true` by the parent Timeline.

## Example

<Playground>
  <ShowCase height="20px" render={({ setProperties, position }) => {
    const duration = 333;
    return (
      <Timeline position={position} duration={duration} setProperties={setProperties}>
        <TimelineInformation playMode="ondemand" duration={duration} />
      </Timeline>
    );  
  }}/>
</Playground>

The component is here shown within a timeline.

## Props

<PropsTable of={TimelineInformation} />

Props marked with ⇘ are updated with the video streamer's state property having the same name, when connected by the `connectControl()` HOC. The ︎`setProperties()` callback prop is marked with ︎⇗ because it is connected for changing the playback state.

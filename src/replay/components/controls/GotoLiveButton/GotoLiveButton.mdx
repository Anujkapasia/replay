# GotoLiveButton

Control bar button for resuming after timeshifting to the live edge of the stream. Only rendering/relevant for live DVR streams.

## Summary

The GotoLiveButton is a toggle button, but it can only toggle if the prop `isAtLiveEdge` is `false`. When clicking the button in this case, it invokes `setProperties({ isAtLiveEdge: true })`. If the button prop `isAtLiveEdge` is `true`, the button can present a different state, and clicking it has no effect.

## Example

<Playground>
  <ShowCase render={({ setProperties, isAtLiveEdge }) => (
    <GotoLiveButton isAtLiveEdge={isAtLiveEdge} isAtLiveEdgeContent="Live" isNotAtLiveEdgeContent="Go to live" playMode="livedvr" setProperties={setProperties} />
  )}/>
</Playground>

## Props

<PropsTable of={GotoLiveButton} />

Props marked with ⇘ are updated with the video streamer's state property having the same name, when connected by the `connectControl()` HOC. The ︎`setProperties()` callback prop is marked with ︎⇗ because it is connected for changing the playback state.

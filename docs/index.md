# Replay

## Guides

### I want to:

‣ [Insert the standard Replay player into my React web page](insert#inserting-the-player-and-playing-videos)

‣ [Insert the standard Replay player and play advanced/professional streams](insert#playing-professional-streams)

‣ [Configure my inserted Replay player](customize#configuring-the-player)

‣ [Select which controls to be included when inserting the Replay player](customize#including-or-omitting-player-control-elements)

TODO: 

‣ [Replace or change graphics, texts, styles, in the standard player UI](#)

‣ [Apply my own user interface and control set to Replay](#)

‣ [Include my own UI, model layer, etc., custom integrations, and assemble my own full player with the Replay controller and video streamer](#)

Consider keeping this separate: ‣ [Integrate with a REST API, monitor playback events and state, play video ads](#)

‣ [Create a video streamer component wrapping a specific player library or enabling a specific streaming technology](#)

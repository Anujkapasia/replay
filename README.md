# Replay

Replay is a **Re**act **play**er controls component library and a full player component, planned to be independent to Vimond environments and earlier projects.

It is also a **replay**cement (pun intended) for the legacy and non-React Vimond **Re**ference **Play**er currently used for testing streams in [Streamlab](http://streamlab.ops.vmp.vimondtv.com/). With a modular approach, all earlier playback technology integrations, including Silverlight, can be utilised with this player, until more direct and modern integrations are written.

Further, it is just a training project without any big intentions in the Vimond perspective, so please disregard for work matters.

Curiousity about the code, technologies used, and problems to be solved, is on the other hand welcome.
